# Image-Steganography

In this project, an image file (of .bmp format) is used as an input (carrier) 
to the Encoding “secret .txt”(It can be of any format) of prescribed size will be encoded to there by generate a 
“stego img.bmp” (encoded file user can provide name or it will take default name). This file (i.e stego_img.bmp) will be then used as an 
input to the Decoding Algorithm, which will ultimately generate back the "secret.txt”(Same format which is given as input) as its 
output.
